Net Present Value (NPV) is a financial metric used to evaluate the profitability of an investment or project. It represents the difference between the present value of cash inflows and the present value of cash outflows over a specific period.

Here’s a basic breakdown of how it works:

Estimate Cash Flows: Predict the future cash inflows and outflows associated with the investment or project.

Determine the Discount Rate: This is the rate of return required or the cost of capital. It reflects the time value of money—how much a dollar today is worth compared to a dollar in the future.

Calculate Present Value of Cash Flows: Discount each future cash flow back to its present value using the discount rate.

Sum of Present Values: Add up the present values of all future cash inflows and outflows.

Compute NPV: Subtract the initial investment (if it's a cash outflow) from the sum of the discounted cash inflows.
